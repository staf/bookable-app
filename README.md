# Bookable App

Development application for a "fun" side project of creating a booking system library/framework. The actual library is placed in the main [Bookable](https://github.com/staf/bookable) repository.

If the library becomes a thing this application will probably morph into a demonstration of how to use the library. In other words, this is a work in progress that isn't guaranteed to become anything useful.
